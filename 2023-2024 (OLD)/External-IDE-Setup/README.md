# How to setup an external IDE for development
## What is an external IDE?
An external IDE is an IDE that you install into your machine. WoofJS is not one for example, because you can access it from the web.
The upside to these versus web based IDE's is they are much stronger. My prefered IDE of choice is Vscode, because it has a built in terminal, file system, and Git which helps reduce clutter. Eventually you may try other IDE's and decide which ones you like the best, but today I will show you how to setup Vscode.
## Installation
Installing Vscode is very simple - you simply go [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and select the version for your operating system. Run the installer, and your set!
## Extensions
Extensions are how Vscode can be expanded upon and allows you to work with other languages. This can be found in the extensions tab on the left, and you can install whatever extensions you may need for whatever project you are working on.
