# 10/1/24 Meeting Log
## Overview
This meeting we went over the basics of Functions, a way to reuse blocks of code!
## Functions
To create a function, you use the `function` keyword:
```js
function name() {
    //Any code written here gets ran whenever you call the function! This makes code reusable.
}
```
After defining a function, you can call it to run its code anywhere else in your code!
```js
//Some cool code
name() //Call the function, executing any code contained within it
//Continue with some cool code that runs after the function finishes
```
### Parameters
Where things get more helpful is when you add in the ability for a function to take an input value, which can be done really easily:
```js
function foo(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    //Now inside the function's body you are able to use parameter1 and 2 as variables in your code!
    //For example, we could add them together and store result!
    let bar = parameter1 + parameter2
}

//Then somewhere else to call the function...
foo(var1,var2) //var1 becomes parameter1 inside the function, and var2 becomes parameter2. Think of it like giving them a temporary name
```
Parameters can be anything, numbers, strings, booleans, rectangles, circles, even other functions!\
Make sure if you define a function to take two parameters, you always pass it two parameters.\
If you accidentally forget to pass a value, the function could error (or worse, accept it and do something really weird with the undefined value)
### Scope
One interesting part about functions, any code contained within them is put into its own thing call scope. We will learn more about scope later, but for now you just need to understand that any code written within a function can not be used outside of it. For example:
```js
function foo(){
    let bar = 7
}
//Somewhere else in the code, OUTSIDE of the function
bar += 1 //ERROR bar is undefined, it does not exist outside of the function
```
