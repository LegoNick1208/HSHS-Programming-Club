# Meeting notes for the 10/3/23 meeting:

Today we went over the basics of debugging your program, and I told the funny moth story! Everyone continued/started working on their first level 1 tutorial after Star Catcher, to make sure everyone has the basics down. 

We also went over how to get input from the keyboard. If you did not get it here is how to do it:
First you need an if statment, to actually do the checking. This will typically be inside a loop somewhere, because remember an if statment just sitting outside in your code will only run once!

```
//Inside a loop somewhere
if(keysDown.includes("KEY"){
  //Do something when the key is pressed here!
}
```

Remember, you can also use the logical operators on this as well, to create more complex statments!

At the next meeting we will finish up these first level 1 tutorials, and then learn the next important concept for programming! Until then, have fun making your first games!
