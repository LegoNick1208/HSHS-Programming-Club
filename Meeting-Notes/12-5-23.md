# Meeting Notes for the 12/5/23 Meeting

This meeting was the first meeting for presentations!

We saw two games this meeting, and one 3d Renderer made by Nathan lol. Everyone got to have some fun playing the games, showing off their creations, etc. Next meeting we will continue showing off games, and then we will have one final meeting before winter break!
