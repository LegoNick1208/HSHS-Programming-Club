# Programming Club
## This repository is for all things Programming Club related, for teaching material, templates for projects, and more!
Programming Club is a new club at HSHS with the goal of teaching complete beginners programming!
Feel free to use this teaching material, or modify it to suit your own needs!

## How do I use this repository?
UNDER DEVELOPMENT

## Who can use this material? Are there any hardware limitations?
I will try my best to ensure all material is as accessible as I can, however more complex topics will expect you to have a computer that can run an actual IDE, alongside install anything required for the project or lesson. (Examples, Node packages, language compilers/runtimes, etc.)
Anything expected to be installed will be detailed, with instructions on how to easily install them. The basic introduction lessons and projects will be available to people with School provided Chromebooks, provided the websites we will be using are not blocked.
